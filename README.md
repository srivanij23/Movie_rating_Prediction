# Movie Rating Prediction

## Overview

The **Movie Rating Prediction** project uses machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings based on various features like movie genres, cast, director, and user reviews. By leveraging data science methods, this project aims to predict how a user might rate a particular movie, thus enabling personalized movie recommendations. This project showcases the application of predictive analytics and machine learning in the recommendation system domain.

## Installation

To get the Movie Rating Prediction project up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srivanij23/Movie-Rating-Prediction.git
   cd Movie-Rating-Prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder (or adjust the path in the code accordingly).

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Python** for the primary programming language
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** for numerical computing
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras** (if deep learning models are applied)
- **Flask/Django** (Optional, for web deployment)

## [Data Sources](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [insert dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, IMDb, etc.]. It contains valuable information like:

- Movie details (title, genre, cast, director, etc.)
- User ratings and reviews
- Movie release year, box office revenue, etc.

Before feeding the data into the model, ensure that it is preprocessed to handle missing values and standardized formats.

## Features

Key features of this Movie Rating Prediction system include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Deals with missing data and encodes categorical features.
   - Normalizes numerical data to enhance model performance.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Implements basic machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or more complex models like Neural Networks.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV to find the best model settings.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared.
   - Provides visual representations to understand model errors.

4. **Prediction System**:
   - Predicts ratings for new and unseen movies.
   - Personalizes ratings based on user preferences and historical data.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plots showing distribution of movie ratings.
   - Correlation between movie features and predicted ratings.

## Model Building Process

The steps taken to build the movie rating prediction model include:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removing any rows with missing or inconsistent data.
   - Encoding categorical features (like genres, cast) into numeric values.
   - Scaling numerical data using tools like StandardScaler.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selecting important features such as cast, genre, director, etc.
   - Creating new features like average movie ratings or genre popularity.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Initial models used include Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
   - More complex models like Random Forest and Deep Learning models (e.g., Neural Networks) are explored.

4. **Training**:
   - Data is split into training and testing sets (usually 80/20 or 70/30).
   - The model is trained on the training set, and evaluated on the testing set.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using performance metrics like MSE and R2 score.
   - Visualizing the accuracy of predictions using charts.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted ratings.
- **R-Squared (R²)**: Shows how well the model’s predictions match the actual data. 
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides the error in the original rating scale, helping gauge prediction accuracy.

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can run the Movie Rating Prediction model as follows:

### Example Usage

1. **Running the Model**:

   ```bash
   python app.ipynb
   ```

2. **Predicting Ratings**:

   After training the model, use it to predict ratings for unseen movies:
   ```python
   from movie_rating_predictor import predict_ratings
   predicted_ratings = predict_ratings(new_movies_data)
   print(predicted_ratings)
   ```

3. **Web Interface** :
  
   ```bash
   Streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Then, visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to interact with the model.
